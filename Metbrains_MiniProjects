# Metbrains MiniProjects

This folder contains **mini-projects and homework assignments** completed as part of the **Metbrains cybersecurity learning program**.

The mini-projects focus on short, practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts and develop hands-on skills in areas such as:

- Network reconnaissance and information gathering  
- Vulnerability identification and basic analysis  
- Security concepts and protocols  
- Practical use of cybersecurity tools and techniques  

Each mini-project is scoped to a specific topic or task and represents incremental learning steps toward larger, full-scale cybersecurity projects.
